# bidimarkdown-spec
Pre-defined specification for bidirectional text support in Markdown.

## Specification
- [CommonMark](./spec/CommonMark/spec.txt).
- [GFM](./spec/GFM/spec.txt).

## Disclaimer
This is just a draft of a proposal for [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/) and [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) specs that aims to add support for bidirectional content.

The draft is still in its early stages, but writing implementations for it is encouraged.
